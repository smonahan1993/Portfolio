# Portfolio

This was an assignment given to me for my second week of Georgia Tech's Coding Bootcamp. 

I have created a personal portfolio of my work which includes a link to my resume as well as links to various projects I have built. 

I will continue to update this as I create content, so now I have only uploaded week 1's "Coding Refractor" assignment. 

Stay tuned for more!
